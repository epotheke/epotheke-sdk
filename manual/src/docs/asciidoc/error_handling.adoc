== 3. Error Handling

The epotheke SDK provides different methods of providing errors, which depend on the time when an error occurs and the underlying reason.

In particular one can distinguish between 

* `General Service Errors` 
* `Operational Errors `

=== 3.1. General Service Error Codes

General Service Error Codes show problems which are not or not directly related to the process of an authentication, but prevent a successful execution.
As an example of a general error is that NFC is not available or not enabled on the device.
These codes occur in the `SdkErrorHandler` as result code within the `ServiceErrorResponse` object.
The latter also contains a more descriptive message which can be obtained by `getErrorMessage`.

The codes are:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Error Code |Description

|NOT_AUTHORIZED
|Indicates that the requesting app is not authorized to use the CardLink servie.

|NFC_NOT_AVAILABLE
|Indicates that NFC is not available on the device.

|NFC_NOT_ENABLED
|Indicates that NFC is not enabled on the device.

|NO_CONNECTION
|Indicates that no connection to the CardLink service could be established.

|LOST_CONNECTION
|Indicates that the connection to the CardLink service was lost.

|NFC_NO_EXTENDED_LENGTH
|Indicates that the corresponding smartphone device does not support nfc with extended length.

|NOT_REQUIRED_API_LEVEL
|Indicates that the corresponding device is rather old and does not support the required API level.

|ALREADY_STARTED
|Indicates that a CardLink process is already started.
| ALREADY_STOPPED
|Indicates that a CardLink process is already stopped.

|INTERNAL_ERROR
|Indicates other internal errors.

|SHUTDOWN_FAILED
|Indicates that the shutdown of the app failed for some internal reason.

=== 3.2 Operational Error Codes

==== 3.2.1 Major Result Codes
When a CardLink process is finished, the `ActivationResult` is provided within the completion handler.
This result contains a major `ResultCode`, which can be `OK`, indicating a successful process or other codes indicating some problem.

Those major codes are:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|`ResultCode` | Description

|OK
|The CardLink process was successful.
|REDIRECT
|Is currently not used for CardLink.
|CLIENT_ERROR
|An error occured on the client side.
|INTERRUPTED
|The process was aborted, e.g. by cancellation of the user.
|INTERNAL_ERROR
|An internal problem within the SDK happened.
|DEPENDING_HOST_UNREACHABLE
|The CardLink server was not able to connect to a needed service (e.g. the electronic prescription service).
|BAD_REQUEST
|The CardLink service was not able to read and understand the sent data.

|===

In addition to the Major Result Codes listed above, there may be a minor code within the `AuthenticationResult`.
Those minor error codes can contain CardLink specific error codes, which are listed in the following. 


==== 3.2.2 Cardlink specific Minor Error Codes

Cardlink specific errors are divided into 

* `Client Error Codes` - are provided by the SDK directly and 
* `Cardlink Error Codes` - are problems, which are delivered from the CardLink service to the SDK.

These codes can occur as a minor error code within an `AuthenticationResult` object, if the process ends.
They are also used during a `CardlinkInteraction` phase, to indicate problems with the current step.
The latter happens when a problem is recoverable and a step can be retried.
For example, if a wrong CAN was provided by the user in the first `onCanRequest`, the SDK will call `onCanRetry` which enables to retry the input of the CAN and provides a corresponding error code.

===== 3.2.2.1 Client Error Codes

Client error codes will be solely used on the client side.
That means that those errors are produced without any communication to the CardLink service.
Usually, those errors indicate a failed card authentication by interrupting the process, providing a wrong CAN or similar errors.
In general, the following error codes are used:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Client Error Code |Description | Occurrence

|CAN_EMPTY
|No CAN or an empty CAN was provided.
|During interaction

|CAN_TOO_LONG
|A CAN with more than 6 digits was provided.
|During interaction

|CAN_NOT_NUMERIC
|CAN contains one or more non-numeric characters.
|During interaction

|CAN_STEP_INTERRUPTED
|Entering the CAN and the subsequent card authentication process was interrupted or cancelled by the user for example.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|CARD_REMOVED
|The card was removed from the NFC field while communicating with it.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|CAN_INCORRECT
|An incorrect CAN was provided.
|During interaction

|OTHER_PACE_ERROR
|Used for other PACE errors that can happen when communicating with the card. Further details are provided in the error message.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|INVALID_SLOT_HANDLE
|Can occur when the "slot handle" of the card has become invalid, which may occur after some NFC-related communication error.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|OTHER_NFC_ERROR
|Used for other NFC errors that can occur when communicating with the card. Further details are provided in the error message.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|CLIENT_TIMEOUT
|Indicates that the CardLink process timed out, which may be due to other errors. 
|Within authentication result

|OTHER_CLIENT_ERROR
|For all other errors. Further details are provided in the error message.
|Within authentication result

===== 3.2.2.2 CardLink Error Codes

This section lists all errors that are returned by the CardLink service.
The CardLink service returns those errors via the `TaskListErrorPayload`, where the error code is transmitted via an Integer value under the hood.
This Integer value is mapped to a list of result codes which are listed in the following:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|CardLink Error Code |Description | Occurrence

|NOT_FOUND
|Is returned when a requested or referenced entity could not be found in the CardLink service.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|SICCT_ERROR
|Is used when an error happens during SICCT communication with the "Konnektor".
|Within authentication result

|PROCESS_ALREADY_STARTED
|Indicates that a CardLink process is already ongoing. This error may occur for example, when the `registerEGK` message is sent twice.
|Within authentication result

|UNKNOWN_WEBSOCKET_MESSAGE
|Indicates that an unknown/unsupported WebSocket message was received by the CardLink service.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_WEBSOCKET_MESSAGE
|Indicates that the CardLink service received an invalid WebSocket message. This can occur if required data are missing or the encoding of the message is wrong.
|Within authentication result

|EGK_LIMIT_REACHED
|Is used when the limit of 10 eGK transactions per session is reached.
|Within authentication result

|SESSION_EXPIRED
|Is used when the established CardLink session has exceeded the permissible 15 minutes. A new WebSocket connection and a new phone pairing must be established.
|Within authentication result

|EXPIRED_CERTIFICATE
|If the CardLink service receives an expired certificate in the `registerEGK` message.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_CERTIFICATE
|Indicates that the CardLink service received an invalid eGK certificate. This can occur when the signature is invalid, a non-eGK certificate is sent or a production eGK certificate is sent when the staging environment is used.
|Within authentication result

|CERTIFICATE_VALIDITY_MISMATCH
|Is used on a mismatch between certificate validity periods of X.509 and CVC.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_GDO
|CardLink service is not able to parse the received EF.GDO in the `registerEGK` message.
|Within authentication result

|ICCSN_MISMATCH
|Indicates a mismatch between the ICCSN in the CV certificate and the EF.GDO.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_EF_ATR
|CardLink service is not able to parse the received EF.ATR in the `registerEGK` message.
|Within authentication result

|UNABLE_TO_SEND_SMS
|CardLink service is not able to send out SMS messages for TAN validation due to some internal problem.

|NOT_ADMISSIBLE_TEL_PREFIX
|Not admissible telephone number prefix is used. CardLink allows only German telephone numbers with "+49" as prefix.

|Within authentication result

|UNKNOWN_ERROR
|Indicates an unknown error and is used on internal server errors for example. Further details are provided in the error message.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

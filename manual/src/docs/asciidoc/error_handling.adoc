== Error Handling
The epotheke SDK provides different methods of providing errors, which depend on the time when an error occurs and the underlying reason.

=== Service Error Codes
Service error codes show problems which are not or not directly related to the process of an authentication, but prevent a successful execution.
For example if NFC is not available or not disabled.
These codes occur in the `SdkErrorHandler` as result code within the `ServiceErrorResponse` object.
The latter also contains are descriptive message which can be obtained by `getErrorMessage`

The codes are:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Error Code |Description

|NFC_NOT_AVAILABLE
|Indicates that nfc is not available on the device.

|NFC_NOT_ENABLED
|Indicates that nfc is not enabled.

|NO_CONNECTION
|Indicates that no connection to the cardlink service could be established.

|LOST_CONNECTION
|Indicates that the connection to the service was lost.

|NFC_NO_EXTENDED_LENGTH
|Indicates that the corresponding smartphone device doesn't support nfc with extended length.

|NOT_REQUIRED_API_LEVEL
|Indicates that the corresponding device does not support the required API level.

| ALREADY_STARTED
|Indicates that a process is already started.
| ALREADY_STOPPED
|Indicates that a process is already stopped.

|INTERNAL_ERROR
|Indicates other internal errors.

|SHUTDOWN_FAILED
|Indicates that the shutdown of the app failed.

|===

=== Major error Codes
When an authentication process is finished the `ActivationResult` is provided within the completion handler.
This result contains a major ResultCode, which can be `OK`, indicating a successful authentication or other codes indicating a problems.

Those major codes are:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Result Code |Description

|OK
|The authentication process was successful
|REDIRECT
|Not used.
|CLIENT_ERROR
|An error occured on the client side.
|INTERRUPTED
|The process was aborted
|INTERNAL_ERROR
|A problem within the SDK happened
|DEPENDING_HOST_UNREACHABLE
|The server side was not able to connect to a needed service
|BAD_REQUEST
|The service could not read sent data

|===

In addition to the Result Code a minor code can be contained within the `AuthenticationResult`
Those minor codes can contain cardlink specific codes which are listed in the following.

=== Cardlink specific error codes

Cardlink specific errors are divided in `Client Error Codes` and `Cardlink Error Codes`.
These codes can occur as a minor code within an `AuthenticationResult` object, if the process ends.
They are also used during a `CardlinkInteraction` phase, to indicate problems with the current step.
The latter happens when a problem is recoverable and a step can be retried.
For example, if a wrong CAN was provided by the user in the first `onCanRequest`, the SDK will call `onCanRetry` which enables to retry the input of the CAN and provides a corresponding error code.

Card link specific errors are distinguished whether the SDK detects and provides them directly (`Client Error Codes`), and `Cardlink Error Codes`, which are problems the service delivers to the SDK.

==== Client Error Codes

Client error codes will be used on the client-side.
That means that those errors are produced without any communication to the CardLink service.
Usually, those errors indicate a failed card authentication by interrupting the process, providing a wrong CAN or similar errors.
In general, the following error codes are used:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Client Error Code |Description | Occurrence

|CAN_EMPTY
|No or an empty CAN was provided.
|During interaction

|CAN_TOO_LONG
|A CAN with more than 6 digits was provided.
|During interaction

|CAN_NOT_NUMERIC
|CAN does contain non-numeric characters.
|During interaction

|CAN_STEP_INTERRUPTED
|Entering CAN and Card authentication process was interrupted.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|CARD_REMOVED
|Card was removed while communicating with it.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|CAN_INCORRECT
|An incorrect CAN was provided.
|During interaction

|OTHER_PACE_ERROR
|Used for other PACE errors that can happen when communicating with the card. Further details are provided in the error message.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|INVALID_SLOT_HANDLE
|Can occur when slot handle of the card has become invalid.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|OTHER_NFC_ERROR
|Used for other NFC errors that can occur when communicating with the card. Further details in error message.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|CLIENT_TIMEOUT
|If a process timed out.
|Within authentication result

|OTHER_CLIENT_ERROR
|For all other errors. Further details are provided in the error message.
|Within authentication result

|===

==== CardLink Error Codes

This section lists all errors that are returned by the CardLink service.
The CardLink service returns those errors via the `TaskListErrorPayload` where the error code is transmitted via an Integer value.
This Integer value is mapped to a list of result codes which are listed in the following:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|CardLink Error Code |Description | Occurrence

|NOT_FOUND
|Returned when a requested entity could not be found.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

|SICCT_ERROR
|Is used when an error happens during SICCT communication with the connector.
|Within authentication result

|PROCESS_ALREADY_STARTED
|Indicates that a CardLink process is already ongoing. This error probably occurs when the `registerEGK` message is sent twice.
|Within authentication result

|UNKNOWN_WEBSOCKET_MESSAGE
|Indicates that an unknown/unsupported WebSocket message was received by the CardLink service.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_WEBSOCKET_MESSAGE
|Indicates that the CardLink service received an invalid WebSocket message. This can occur if required data are missing or the encoding is wrong.
|Within authentication result

|EGK_LIMIT_REACHED
|Is used when the limit of 10 eGK authentications per session is reached.
|Within authentication result

|SESSION_EXPIRED
|Is used when the paired session has exceeded the permissible 15 minutes. A new connection and a new phone pairing must be established.
|Within authentication result

|EXPIRED_CERTIFICATE
|If the CardLink service receives an expired certificate in the `registerEGK` message.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_CERTIFICATE
|Indicates that the CardLink service received an invalid eGK certificate. This can occur when the signature is invalid, a non-eGK certificate is sent or a production eGK certificate is sent when the reference environment is used.
|Within authentication result

|CERTIFICATE_VALIDITY_MISMATCH
|Is used on a mismatch between certificate validity periods of X.509 and CVC.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_GDO
|CardLink service is not able to parse the received EF.GDO in the `registerEGK` message.
|Within authentication result

|ICCSN_MISMATCH
|Indicates a mismatch between ICCSN in CV certificate and EF.GDO.
|Within authentication result

|INVALID_EF_ATR
|CardLink service is not able to parse the received EF.ATR in the `registerEGK` message.
|Within authentication result

|UNABLE_TO_SEND_SMS
|CardLink service is not able to send out SMS messages for TAN validation.
|Within authentication result

|NOT_ADMISSIBLE_TEL_PREFIX
|Not admissible telephone number prefix is used. CardLink allows only German telephone numbers (+49).
|During interaction

|NUMBER_BLOCKED
|Indicates that a blocked phone number is used.
|During interaction

|TAN_EXPIRED
|If the TAN for the SMS-TAN validation has expired.
|During interaction

|TAN_INCORRECT
|Indicates that a wrong TAN was provided.
|During interaction

|TAN_RETRY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
|The TAN retry limit exceeded.
|During interaction

|SERVER_TIMEOUT
|Used when the client does not receive any more commands of the CardLink service. This can happen when the App is waiting for the `InternalAuthenticate` APDU but does not receive one.
|Within authentication result

|UNKNOWN_ERROR
|Indicates an unknown error and is used on internal server errors. Further details are provided in the error message.
|During interaction, Within authentication result

The epotheke SDK provides an API which can be integrated directly using the `SdkCore` class.
To eliminate the need to write platform specific glue code, there are platform specific classes, which can be used instead.
On Android, the `SdkActivity` can be extended, so only the App specific interaction handlers need to be implemented.

The epotheke SDK contains three handlers, that need to be implemented:

`SdkErrorHandler`:: for handling errors related to the SDK initialisation
`CardLinkInteraction`:: for exchanging data between the user and the CardLink service
`CardLinkControllerCallback`:: for providing the CardLink result and protocols for subsequent processes (e.i. Prescription retrieval/selection)
